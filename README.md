# knife-or-not
Creating a tool to identify knives once and for all.

Image Classification has long been a settled problem and is now more like the 'hello world' of deep learning, where you are just trying out all the pieces as you get started. Still, I wanted to try it on my ownâ€“ so just like Crocodile Dundee, the model I created can confidently say "That's not a knife. THIS is a knife."

This is a first deep learning project for me- a way to have fun and create my own progressive challenges. I've uploaded all the code in these notebooks to show my work and progress, as well as some mistakes that I learned from. Any comments are greatly appreciated and thanks for checking this out!
